
## Introduction

This is a very simple Monte Carlo Path Tracing program. 

It supports diffuse reflection, specularity, mirror reflection and refraction.

It use phong model to deal with reflections.

## Use

It has been tested on Windows+VS and macOS+XCode.

On Windows, remember to use x64 (because my freeglut was compiled to x64) 
  and copy the OpenGL/freeglut.dll to the directory where your generated .exe is in.

On both OS, remember to use Release to make it run fastly.
